# Outward-MapPlayerMarker-Mod
This is a simple map marker mod for Outward.
This mod shows the player position and the direction they are looking at.
It has been only tested in __Single Player__, but it *should* also work for co-op.

While making this mod, I have used some code from __https://github.com/sinaioutlander/Outward-Mods__. The mentioned repository also contains a lot of different mods.

# Knows Bugs
* Sometimes when opening the map, an NPC will also get his or her marker updated and it will show as the mod's marker. In the code, I always use the Game's method **_IsAI()_** before drawing. I suspect that, this bug is caused in the Game's method. However it does not affect you, nor your gameplay in anyway.
  * If you know a fix to this, please create an Issue.

# Todo
* Add pictures of the mod.
